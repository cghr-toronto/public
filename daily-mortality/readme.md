## varying covariances pollution model in Stan and daily mortality study

An example of running the proposed varying covariances pollution model is presented in "Example_pollutionModel.R", with the external data "data_all_toronto.RData"  and defined Stan code for pollution model "STAN_pollution_model.stan".

The raw hourly monitoring pollution data can be downloaded by R code in folder “Obtain_pollution”.
The R code related to fitting disease model is in folder "Disease_model".

Note: the govenment of Canada had updated the links (ways) to download NAPS data. The folder "New_pollutionModel_example" is an example to fit our proposed pollution model using the updated links.
