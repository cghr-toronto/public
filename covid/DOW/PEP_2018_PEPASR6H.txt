Annual Estimates of the Resident Population by Sex, Age, Race, and Hispanic Origin for the United States and States: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2018

Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes
to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution
program and geographic program revisions. Median age is calculated
based on single year of age. Hispanic origin is considered an
ethnicity, not a race.  Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of
"Some Other Race" from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in
differences between the population for specific race categories shown
for the 2010 Census population in this table versus those in the
original 2010 Census data. For more information, see
