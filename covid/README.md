## How to use this repository


## COVID-19 data in this repository

Currently, the COVID-19 related data can be found in our [data repository](https://github.com/cghr-toronto/covid-data).

**Note**: The data in our repository will be updated twice a weeek for the duration of the global pandemic.


## COVID-19 R code in this repository

### COVID-19 Forecasting R code

**Note**: In our [COVID-19 forecasting paper](https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069161v1) we mostly used data from Coronavirus App. The forecasting R script shared in this repository uses the publicly available John Hopinks CSSE data so that anyone can run our models.
