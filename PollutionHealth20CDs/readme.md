Files 1-3 were utilized to download and implement the pollution model, resulting in daily exposure estimates. The file `exposure.RData` serves as an example of these pollution exposure estimates. Exposure data for other cities can be made available upon request.

Please note that health data are not publicly available due to privacy protection measures. An example demonstrating how to fit the health model (nonlinear over-dispersion case-crossover model) will be uploaded soon.
